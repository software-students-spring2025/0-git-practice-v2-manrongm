[AI-Native Software Engineering May Be Closer Than Developers Think](https://www.cio.com/article/3567138/ai-native-software-engineering-may-be-closer-than-developers-think.html)

## Why This Article is Interesting
The article explores the idea of AI-native software engineering, where artificial intelligence is not just an add-on but deeply embedded in the entire software development lifecycle. It discusses how AI can assist in coding, debugging, testing, and even optimizing software architecture. 

What I find particularly fascinating is the shift in perspective from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator. This paradigm could redefine how we build and maintain software, making the process more efficient and intelligent. The potential for AI to understand and improve code autonomously, coupled with advances in machine learning and natural language processing, hints at a future where software engineers work alongside AI systems in a truly symbiotic relationship.

This is a cool article! It gives an idea that AI might eventually become an integral part of the entire software engineering lifecycle (instead of only being a supplementaryy tool), which raises thought-provoking questions about the evolving role of human developers.
